  "bio": "Mixing that electro thump with the sample-heavy boom-bap of hip-hop, DJ/producer Gramatik was born in Portoroz, Slovenia, but he always seemed bound for Brooklyn. It was an older sister with a large cassette collection who turned the young Gramatik on to tapes of funk, jazz, R&B, and other genres that naturally lent themselves to dancefloors. By the time he was 13, he was making beats on his PC, and by his late teens, his productions had earned him a loyal fan base and, eventually, the attention of the Colorado-based Pretty Lights. The like-minded producer signed Gramatik to his web label, also dubbed Pretty Lights, and released his Beatz & Pieces, Vol. 1 album in 2011. The Digital Freedom EP followed in 2012, along with Gramatik's new apartment in Brooklyn. He founded his own label, Lowtemp, in 2013, and only increased the pace of his recordings, giving away beat-heavy albums like SB#4 and Coffee Shop Selection even as he released proper LPs such as The Age of Reason in 2014 and Epigram in 2016 (both of the latter charted on Billboard's Top Electronic Albums).",

      Canadian grown (legally), New York formed duo Jimmy Vallance and Tom Howie are one of the latest acts to release on the boutique label Scissor and Thread. Although only cordially discussing music and life in the same high school art class in Vancouver BC, it wasn't until several years later that they bumped into each other at a Lowe's parking lot and teamed up to make the act now known as Bob Moses.

    "bio": "The Polish Ambassador, David Sugalski, is raising the bar for what it means to be a professionally touring musician. Sure, the electronic musician lays claim to producing the sweetest beats this side of the Milky Way Galaxy, but the world’s funkiest diplomat is also using his popularity to steer the millennial generation toward a nourishing and sustainable way of relating with art, community and the planet. From birthing the Permaculture Action Movement, to creating a program where nutritious beverage options are available at music venues on a routed TPA tour, the ambassador is using his clout to make real, tangible change while inspiring hundreds of thousands along the way. 
      Over the last decade, The Polish Ambassador’s sound has dipped and swirled through a staggering range of styles, each album exploring uncharted sonic territory. Warm analogue dreamwave, mind-altering glitch, world-infused groove, bass-fueled breaks, sexified downtempo, electric lullabies, and psy-fi funk are just a few of the genres that have poured from the Ambassador’s soul into earbuds and ghetto-blasters across the galaxy. 
      In the live setting, expect to be taken on a masterfully crafted and evocative journey mixing old and new into an auditory canvas that will spark nostalgia, titillate your senses and make you drop that bottom like it was ‘92…3092. All of that music you hear? It’s all created via solar power on TPA’s off-grid community homestead AND it’s available for free or “Name Your Price.” Just one of the ways The Ambassador says \"Thank You\" to all of the people out there who have supported the project along the way. 
      So, if TPA’s earth-space escalade is docking at a city or festival near you then dust off your onesie, get ready to boogie and gear up for an epic community action day. Welcome to the future... where we don’t just party, we party with a purpose.",

In 2008, he got his first copy of the digital production software, Reason, and started producing his own dance music. Slowly but surely, he began to immerse himself in the LA and San Diego club scenes. By 2013, Kevin had completed multiple professional degrees in audio engineering and production. Shortly thereafter the vision for the SNBRN brand emerged and Kevin embarked on a new creative path. Recognizing the increasing popularity of deep house, indie dance, and nu disco Kevin envisioned a brand that combined all the best elements of each sub-genre while remaining instantly accessible.
        In May of 2014, the SNBRN project was launched with a series of viral covers and remixes. He
      was quickly met with a series of career milestones including: multiple HypeMachine chart topping
      releases, tens of millions of plays on SoundCloud and YouTube, and direct support from Pete Tong
      on BBC Radio 1. The SNBRN brand has rapidly solidified itself as an overnight sensation in the
      house music world with official releases on Atlantic, Astralwerks, Spinnin’ Records, Ultra,
      Republic and Sony.",

      where he joined forces with Flying Lotus and the Brainfeeder constellation, acting as an
      essential linchpin, the wild card electrifying the masses and slaughtering the heathens. He's
      played almost every major festival in the world, but still makes sure to wreck shop every
      Wednesday at The Airliner (home of Low End Theory). Over the last several years, GLK has amassed
      a new arsenal of weapons. Once primarily known for his atomic live sets and hypnotic mixes, he's
      evolved into a singular auteur. He can produce for himself and others, both on-stage and in the
      studio. Watching him conduct a live band recalls the frenetic genius of LA Philharmonic maestro,

    "bio": "By the mid 80's, Chris Manak was DJing and making his own beats for MCs. A few years later, he met 16-year-old rapper Charizma and they soon signed with Hollywood Records. In December 1993, the world lost Charizma to gun violence. Wolf took a break. \"Making beats\" eventually became therapy for the next few years. In 1996, he started Stones Throw Records out of his bedroom as a vinyl-only record label that catered to DJs. His own album My Vinyl Weighs A Ton, was the most successful release of the label's early years. In 2001, Wolf moved to Los Angeles, bringing hip hop artist Madlib along with him, who became the center of the label for many years. Wolf has also curated albums for Adult Swim, 2K Sports, Serato, and Urban Outfitters. He has also discovered Mayer Hawthorne and Aloe Blacc, encouraging both artists who were rappers at the time to become singers. 
      After three decades of vinyl DJing, PBW now prefers A/V sets, playing music videos pulled from
      his personal collection of rare VHS, DVD, laserdisc, beta, etc. Whether it's a private dinner
      party for Bill Clinton, a string of dates with the Beastie Boys, Gwen Stefani's birthday party,
      or his own high school reunion, Wolf is equally at home behind the turntables.
      A documentary on the life of PB Wolf and his label Stones Throw, Our Vinyl Weighs A Ton, is now
      playing at film festivals, focusing on the path of Chris and the record label he created nearly
      20 years ago.",
